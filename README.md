## How to run the code
You are going to need a mac with Xcode and an appid

You can test the code by running the UI in Simulator or Device, enter a complete string of Bowling frames and press enter to watch the
result.
As the assignment said the string must be complete and any input in it valid, the app crashes otherwise since input check was not
in the assignment.

Also there are unit test that can be used to test the code and check coverage.

## Example of Valid string inputs

"X X X X X X X X X X X X" // 300
"7/ 4/ 35 X 7/ 12 -1 -9 X 53" // 105
"9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9-" // 90
"5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/5" // 150
"X X X X X X X X X X33" // 279
